## Project aim

Our primary objective for developing this application was to raise awareness about environmental sustainability and provide practical ideas on how to reduce plastic consumption in our day-to-day activities. Our goal was to develop an application that provides variety of interactive features that would engage users and encourage them to explore the app further. To achieve this, we focused on developing a user-friendly design that is well-balanced in terms of functionality and aesthetics. Overall, our aim was to create an application that not only delivers valuable content but also provides them with a pleasant and memorable experience.
